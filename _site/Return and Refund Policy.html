<p>At Mahavir Wellness, we strive to provide high-quality products. We understand that there may be instances where you need to return an item. Please read our return and refund policy carefully.</p>

<h2 id="1-eligibility-for-refund">1. Eligibility for Refund</h2>

<p>We offer refunds only for items with manufacturing defects. A manufacturing defect is a flaw or error in the productâ€™s construction that impairs its intended use. We do not offer refunds for any other reasons, such as change of mind or accidental damage. Orders placed by error can be refunded if you inform our customer support team before it has been shipped. A nominal order processing fee shall be deducted towards expenses incurred by the company.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contact our customer support team within 7 business days from the date of delivery.</li>
  <li>You are required to provide details about the defect, including photographs, a description of the issue, and your order number.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="3-inspection-and-evaluation">3. Inspection and Evaluation</h2>

<p>Upon receiving your return request, we will review the provided information and may request additional details. We may also request that you return the defective item for further evaluation.</p>

<h2 id="4-refund-process">4. Refund Process</h2>

<p>If your return request is approved, we will issue a refund as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li>For payments made by credit card, the refund will be credited to the original card used for the purchase.</li>
  <li>For payments made by other methods, we will arrange an appropriate refund method.
Please allow 14 business days for the refund to be processed.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="5-return-shipping">5. Return Shipping</h2>

  <li>Products that have been modified or altered.</li>
  <li>Products without the original packaging and tags (if applicable).</li>
  <li>Items damaged during transportation due to mishandling by the shipping carrier.
